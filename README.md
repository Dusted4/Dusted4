- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dusted4 [I'm an associate Professor in Psychology and have expertise in Data Science] 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python  [This is an exercise for me, I can code in visual basic, R and RShiny etc] 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning eye gaze and Pupillometry coding to build an app
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with experts because I have a good market for the design.  My expertise is in design and testing, not coding. 
- 📫 You can help by offering advice, making contact etc at d.walton@cnr.co.nz
